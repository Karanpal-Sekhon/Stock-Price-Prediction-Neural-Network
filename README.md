# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM Neural Network

## Overview

This project implements a stock price prediction model using a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network. The model is built using the Keras and Scikit-learn modules, and the results are visualized using Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib. The primary focus is on predicting the closing price of AAPL Inc. based on the past 60 days' stock prices.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- yfinance
- pandas_datareader

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn keras matplotlib yfinance pandas_datareader
```
